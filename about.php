                        <h4>Team</h4>



                        <p>

                        Lagos Beach Rugby is a 3 a side (rolling subs) touch rugby tournament. Each game is played for 5 mins each way. Each team is allowed a squad of up to 6 players.

There must only be 3 players from each team on the pitch at any one time 

If you want to make a rolling sub you must inform one of the 2 referees.

                        </p>

                        <h4>Defence</h4>



                        <p>

                       A touch or a tackle consists of a 2 handed touch around the hips…..NOT SHOULDER or CHEST

 The game is then restarted by the attacking team tapping the ball off their knee, off their foot or off the ground before giving a pass.

The team in possession are allowed up to 3 touches / tackles before the ball is turned over.

In the occurrence of a turnover in possession or a knock on, the defending team must drop back 3 metres and the attacking team must restart play by tapping the ball off their knee, off their foot or off the ground before giving a pass.

                        <h4>Tackle</h4>



                        <p>

                       There is NO kicking other than at the restart.

A try is scored when a player touches the ball down securely in the goal area at the attacking end of the pitch.

A try should still be given if the player is touched in the motion of scoring – subject to the discretion of the referee.

If the defending team attempts an interception and the ball goes to ground, the attacking team regains possession and gain a new set of 3 touches or tackles.

                        </p>

                        <h4>Referee</h4>



                        <p>

         A deliberate knock-on when intercepting will result in a penalty being given. The attacking side will receive a free pass. If extremely cynical; then a yellow card may be given.

 A yellow card means a player has to spend 2 minutes off the pitch and their team will play with just 2 players.

 A player receiving a red card (very unlikely) will remain off the pitch for the rest of the game. 



Referee's decision is final!!
